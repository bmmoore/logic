logic
=====

A Haskell library for working with First-Order Logic.

Currently quite bare, with just an AST, parser, and pretty-printer.

The plan is to add definitions of signatures and theories,
transformations like CNF conversion and Skolemization,
and resolution (with superposition) and inductive theorem provers.
